# Day 3: Introduction to Data Science

## Slot 1 (09:30 - 11:00): Introduction to Data Science - Session 1: Structured Data:open_file_folder:
**Speaker**: Nikos Bakas, PhD
**Description**:
In this session, we will present Machine Learning algorithms for structured datasets in Julia Language. We start with examples from Linear Algebra, BLAS, and Statistics, followed by Machine Learning Algorithms. Furthermore, the CUDA and Multithreading interface will be presented in a hands-on session, where the participants may try the discussed concepts interactively.

## Slot 2 (11:15 - 12:45): Introduction to Data Science - Session 2: Time-series :chart_with_downwards_trend:
**Speaker**:  Valeria Philippou, PhD
**Description**:
This online training course will provide you with essential knowledge to allow processing, analysis and classification of time series data using libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn and tensorflow for Python programming language. Whether you wish to analyse weather records, healthcare data or stock price, or understand patterns of your time-series data, this training will provide you with theoretical and practical understanding on how to clean, visualise and model time series data in your workflows using Python programming language.

## Slot 3 (13:45 - 15:15): Introduction to Data Science - Session 3: Text :page_with_curl:
**Speaker**:  Nikolas Theodosiou 
**Description**:
In this session, trainees will be introduced to basic text processing methods in Python, in order to classify IMDB movie reviews using Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). For the purposes of this tutorial, we will mainly rely on Pandas, Sklearn and NLTK. Therefore, attendees should be familiar with the basics of the Python programming language.
